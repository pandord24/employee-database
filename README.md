## Description

An command-line application that prompts user to manage a company's employee database.


- My motivation is to learn more about Node.js and Inquirer.
- I built this project to improve my code writing skill. 
- By applying proper syntax with PostgreSQL, it is more organized and easily to identify problems. 
- I learned ways to structure Node.js and Inquirer.
